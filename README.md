# desktop_tropicalia_2021
üèù desktop_tropic√°lia is a tropical island getaway on the Internet. In this time of quarantine, much of my connection to the natural world is now mediated through computer screens. desktop_tropic√°lia highlights the dichotomy and contradictions of developing, tropical island nations and the rapid implementation of technological and networked systems through the hyper-modern intimate act of allowing others to view my computer's desktop. desktop_tropic√°lia was created using a number of multimedia processes including code written JavaScript and C.
